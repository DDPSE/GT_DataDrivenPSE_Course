    "- The Jupyter application is incuded in the Anaconda installation that you must have installed on your laptop by now. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks allow you to read text, click on links, and modify and run code interactively all at the same time. \n",
    "- If you are interested in modifying Jupyter notebooks, and even creating your own in the future, there are tons of resources (turorials and videos) online to help. \n",
    "- You can also use these provided files as a way of teaching yourself how to edit and eventually create your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Below is some basic info:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used types of entries you will make inculde:\n",

    "- Code: Python code \n",
    "- Double-click on each \"box\" to see the code/editable text.\n",

    "Python is a modern, free, general-purpose high-level programming language. Python is used a lot for data analysis and its usage is growing rapidly.\n",

    "Two resources contain some discussion on the differences between Matlab and Python: \n",
    "1. [Python versus Matlab](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html)\n",
    "2. [Overview of differences between Matlab and Python](https://bastibe.de/2013-01-20-a-python-primer-for-matlab-users.html)\n",

    "**Users and developers are finding Python to have certain advantages, such as:**\n",
    "-  Flexibility, it's free and open source, large community that shares material\n",
    "\n",
    "**Of course Matlab still has some advantages over Python:**\n",
    "-  Specialized toolboxes (i.e., simulink), handling of matrices, speed, handling of new versions is less of an issue, user-friendly interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python \"Packages\":**\n",
    "These extend the functionality in Python. Similar to \"toolboxes\" in Matlab. In this class, we will use some of the following:\n",
    "-  numpy (matrix operations)\n",

    "-  matplotlib (plotting)\n",
    "-  pyomo (optimization)\n",
    "-  scikit-learn (machine learning)\n",

    "**Anaconda (Conda):**\n",
    "Managing packages and versions is one of the main challenges with python. (i.e., if a package is built upon a different version, it might not work in a new version). Platforms like Anaconda are cross-platform installation packages of Python, that aim to make this a bit easier for you. Please follow the instructions on the provided instructions file to download everything you need to use in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphical User Interface (Spyder):**\n",
    "With the Anaconda installation, you have access to an interface of Python, that is more user-friendly than writing scripts and running code on the console or terminal. If you open Spyder, you will notice it has a default setup:\n",
    "-  **On the left**, a temporary file is created (**temp.py**). This is where you will start writing a function, that you can store as a .py file to run/execute later.\n",
    "-  On the **bottom right**, you have the **Console**. Here you can interactively execute commands, like the ones we will go over today.\n",
